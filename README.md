# Pen-Testing
A repo for all things that I need for Pen-testing. 

I created this repository as a central location to store all my pen-testing notes and scripts. 
As I continue to enhance my knowledge and skills, I believe this would be the ideal place to gather all my tools, commands, scripts, and notes. 
This way, I can be fully prepared for testing no matter where I am located.
